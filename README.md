# Lesson 03 - Testing react apps

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## The goal

Learn how to write, fix, execute & understand tests in a React application.

## Tips

Follow the [Four rules of simple design](http://www.thinkcode.se/blog/2011/04/06/four-rules-of-simple-design)

  1. Tests Pass - All test should always pass when you change any software
  2. Expresses Intent - Always reveal your intent when you write software. This means that all names, variables, methods, classes, modules...
  3. No Duplication (DRY)
  4. Small - The final rule is that all you create should be small. This means small methods, small parameter lists, small classes and small modules.

Get familiar with [Jest Â· Painless JavaScript Testing - Facebook Code](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)

## Practise & learn

Fork & clone it on your machine, then in the project directory:

```
npm install # takes some time to complete
npm start
npm test
```
