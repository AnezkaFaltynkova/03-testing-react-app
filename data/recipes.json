      "title": "Fig bars",
      "created": "JUNE 12, 2014",
      "ingredients": [
        "1 1/2 cups dried figs, soaked overnight in water",
        "1/4 cup honey",
        "Juice and zest of one lemon",
        "1 1/2 cups oat flour",
        "1 cup almond flour",
        "1/2 cup brown rice flour",
        "1 tsp. baking powder",
        "1/2 tsp. baking soda",
        "1/4 tsp. sea salt",
        "1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk",
        "1/3 cup almond butter",
        "1/2 cup rolled oats, divided",
        "5 Tbsp. coconut sugar, plus more for sprinkling (turbinado works as well)",
        "1 Tbsp. vanilla extract"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "These make for a perfectly sweetened snack or breakfast option. They are delicate and tender, so don't travel quite as well as your typical granola bar but are no less delicious. They are subtly sweet, not overly so which I really liked, but if you want more of a treat, simply add another few tablespoons sugar to the dough. These are wheat, dairy and egg free so work great for people with allergies.",
        "Figs come in two different colors, same goes for the dried variety. I used the lighter shade for these and it's the same color as the dough. Next time I will use dark ones so the contrast shows up. Tastes great either way but I'd prefer seeing the line of fig in between."

      "ingredients": [
        "Four 4 oz. Wild Pacific Salmon Filets",
        "1 Cup Walnuts, Very Finely Chopped",
        "1/4 Cup Whole Wheat Flour (or any gluten free option will work too)",

        "1 Tbsp. Water",
        "1 Tsp. Dried Basil ",
        "1 Tbsp. Oil (anything neutral tasting)",
        "3 1/2 Cups Edamame Beans (organic very important with soy. I used frozen, shelled beans)",
        "2 Tbsp. Rice Vinegar",
        "2 Tbsp. Lemon Juice",
        "2 Tbsp. Toasted Sesame Oil",
        "3 Tbsp. Fresh Chives, Chopped",
        "3 Tbsp. Fresh Mint, Chopped",
        "Fresh Ginger, optional",
        "Fresh Basil for Garnish"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Salt and Pepper to Taste",
        "Oven to 400",
        "Steam or boil edamame beans for about 8 minutes (longer if you're using fresh). Transfer drained beans to a blender or food processor. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, rice vinegar, lemon juice and sesame oil. Pulse to puree the beans.Pulse until chunky, you want a smooth but slightly chunky consistency, add broth or water if you need to loosen it. Tranfer to a mixing bowl, add the fresh mint and chives and stir. Salt and pepper to taste, add ground ginger or red pepper if you want a kick.",
        "Put the egg white and water in a bowl and give it a whisk. Use three seperate shallow plates, put the flour on one, the egg whites mixture in the second, and the crushed walnuts, pinch of salt and herbs in the last bowl.",
        "Heat pan over medium heat with 1 Tbsp. of a neutral oil. With one salmon filet at a time and working with ONE side, dip on the flour, then the egg, then the walnuts (which should be pulverized enough to adhere). Add nut side down gently into the pan and sear for about 3 minutes, flip and sear the other side. Tranfer fish onto a baking dish large enough to hold all four filets, walnut side up. Repeat the searing with all four filets, then pop them in the oven to cook through to desired doneness, about 5-8 minutes depending on thickness. I like to keep it just barely rare on the inside."
