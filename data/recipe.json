    "2 tsp. pure vanilla extract",
    "1 cup / 250ml Sunflower Seed Butter (recipe follows), or use storebought",
    "1⁄2 cup / 125ml pure maple syrup",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",

  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 325°F / 160°C. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and vanilla. Add the seed butter and mix thoroughly. Add the maple syrup, baking soda, and salt and fold together. Sift in the cocoa powder and stir to incorporate. Fold in the chopped chocolate.",
    "Place the sunflower seeds in a separate bowl. Wet your hands slightly with water. Spoon the dough into about 20 portions and roll each into a rough ball (the dough will be very wet, but this is normal!).",
    "Drop the dough balls into the bowl of seeds and roll to coat them in the seeds. Flatten the balls out slightly and place them on the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches / 5cm apart (they spread a lot!).",
    "Bake the cookies for 10 to 13 minutes. Let them cool slightly before serving. Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week."
